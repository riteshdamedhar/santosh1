                                 <p style="text-align:justify;">College of Information Technology and Management science (Citms) has been operational for the last seven year. We have been trying to provide quality education along with an emphasis on the improvement of communication skill and training in relevant fields.</p>
                               <p style="text-align:justify;">We know that quality is a defining element of education today. To improve the quality of education further, we have decided to follow the Education criteria for performance excellence in Higher Education.</p>    
                                 <p style="text-align:justify;">We intend to redefine education in terms of the imperatives of the 21st century in the triple context of Quality, Ethics and Accountability. We desire to retrofire the stakeholders, namely the students and staff, with reference to their need, aspirations and obligations. This shall spell out each one's multi-learning, multi-skill and multi-tasking roles as knowledge workers.</p> <p>We want to restructure our educational experience, both curricular and extracurricular, to be provided at every stage, at all levels, in terms of time frame, contents, activities including teaching evaluating and research. We wish to re-engineer the entire process of interaction covering instruction, testing, remedying, enriching, extension, continuing educational programs, community interface, industry interface and overall management. We will include elements of multimode, multimedia and multi-sourcing to strengthen reprocessing of various tasks and activities.</p>
